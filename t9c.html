	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.4s">
		<h1>Design directions after identifying users</h1>
		<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>+</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A focus on speed and efficiency.</p>
		<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>+</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A focus on large fonts and clear text.</p>
		<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>+</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;De-emphasizing cliched animations and visuals commonly associated with restaurant websites.</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 10px;">After identifying who my users might be, I realized my users would expect the website to give them the information they were looking for <i>fast</i>. They would want the content they were looking for with minimal distractions, visual clutter or annoying popups. As people who value their time, they would appreciate efficiency over visual finesse, <b style="font-weight: 400;">content over chrome.</b></p>
		<p>I pursued a design which pushes the content front and center. The visual elements take a backseat to the content itself. I took inspiration from Microsoft's Metro Design, employed widely in its 2012 range of products and software suites. <b style="font-weight: 400;">My design focuses on typography, with large, bold fonts.</b> I've emphasized the content over flair, similar to Metro design principles. In my design, I wanted to make the information pop out. The user sees exactly what they wanted to see, and nothing more.</p>
		<p>A single-page website plays well into such a 'content-first' approach. Having all the information necessary on a single webpage eliminates messy sitemaps, or loading a handful of different webpages just to get to a single piece of information.</p>
		<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of my identified users wanted a few, specific pieces of key information. Having them scour a large website for it would leave a bad impression about the restaurant. On the other hand, if they could easily access the key informations they were looking for without distractions, it would create quite the positive image.</p>
		<h1 style="padding-top: 45px; padding-bottom: 45px;">A tale of hierarchies</h1>
		<p>I needed to list the features my website would have. Enumerating them, I found five.</p>
		<ol>
			<li class="functionlist">A welcome screen.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">A brief introduction to the restaurant.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">The menu.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">A reservation form.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">A contact section.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>My work process involves prioritizing these functions to create a layout. More users would want to see the menu and know a bit about the restaurant, compared to the few who would want to contact the owners. The 'Menu' and 'About' sections get assigned a higher priority. <b style="font-weight:400;">In designing the website, I created a hierarchy, with the most important elements getting the most visibility and focus through larger fonts, whitespaces, or colored backgrounds.</b></p>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 35px;"><b style="font-weight: 400;">A section has been dedicated to reserving a seat at the restaurant. However, personal experience and anecdotal evidence led me to believe that most people would rather call for a reservation using Google search, or use an app. This is why in my final design I've put the reservation form behind a clickable button to reduce visual clutter and put more emphasis on the menu.</b></p>
		<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 60px; font-size: 1.2rem; border: 1px solid black;">WELCOME=INTRO > MENU > RESERVATION > CONTACT</p>
		<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-top: 5px;">Here's my reasoning, which brings up answers to two questions- who exactly goes to dinner, and what <i>"mood"</i> would they be looking to achieve after the night.</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="functionlist">A fancy restaurant in a metro-city location will attract a lot of office-goers, evidenced by the user personas above.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">"9 to 5" hours in big cities are quite stretched, leaving much of the people with little personal time.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">Being described as "fancy, but utilitarian in cuisine", the restaurant needs to strike a balance between form and function.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">The (overworked) people of large cities go for a night out to get some amount of relaxation.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">The dinner would then be more about having a relaxing experience than just about food.</li>
			<li class="functionlist">It would be unwise to make a customer-base with little time to spare waste any more time in navigating a complicated website for dinner.</li>
			<li class="functionlist"><i>"Reserving" a table is work. Looking at a menu and pictures of food is not.</i></li>
		</ul>
		<p style="padding-bottom: 5px;">This is what my initial design of the individual elements looked like. Prioritizing the elements made it clear to me what i should focus on and what elements can be tucked away behind clickables for visual clarity. This was my little hierarchy so far:</p>
		<img src="images/wf1.png" alt="Wireframe" class="img-fluid center-image" style="max-height: 700px; max-width: 500px;">
		<h1 style="padding-top: 15px;">WIREFRAMING, ITERATIONS, AND FINAL DESIGN</h1>
		<p style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">When I looked at competing restaurants, I found that too many websites rely on long, drawn out animations. This make the webpages slow to load, and a pain to navigate. An emphasize on typography and information over animations inverts the trope of a restaurant's website being "artistic" and makes it a functional tool in the restaurant's business operation.</p><p>In essence, going light on the animations creates a quick-loading website. Prioritizing information over artistry means the website lets the user quickly get to the content they are looking for. <b style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, this creates a quick, efficient and <i>relaxing</i> experience for the user.</b></p>

  			<p>Before I reached the final design, experimenting with a variety of color combinations took me a few days. Three iterations later, Adobe Color had helped me find combinations of color that go well with each other and play off the images well. Given more time, I'd make two prototypes- one in greyscale and the other in color. The greyscale version would serve as a good control for the final design.</p>

  			<ul>
  				<li class="functionlist">I would add an autoplaying carousel to switch between Regular and Special menus, instead of having a clickable button.</li>
  				<li class="functionlist">I would adjust the paddings of some of the elements to make alignment better across all devices.</li>
